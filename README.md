✨ Fun Poetic Touch
In loops and queries, my journey flows,
Through AI’s mind where wisdom grows.

Each dataset whispers, patterns unfold,
A story of logic, endlessly told.

From code that builds to dreams that scale,
I debug the errors, I ship the tale.

A learner, a builder, with visions untold,
Crafting tomorrow in functions of gold.
